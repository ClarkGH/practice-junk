# Basic React Interview Assessment
I've set up a very basic react application, follow the assessment directions to the best of your abilities and ask any questions for clarification.

## To run
1. $ yarn install
2. $ yarn start
3. Open localhost:8080 in your browser
4. run webpack whenever you made a code change (I have not yet implemented hot reloading)

## The Assessment
1. Create a react application that has 4 nodes
2. When you click on one node, change its background color to red
3. When you click on another node, change all nodes back to white, and the clicked node to red.
4. Ask yourself the right questions. What is the best way to going about doing this? What if we had 7 nodes instead of 4? Consider other possibilities. How can you future proof your application?
